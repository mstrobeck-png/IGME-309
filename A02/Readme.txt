I throughly attempted this, enough so I thought a one day extension could help me. I attempted to look at the formulas for all these shapes
and to make through notes on them in a notebook yet somehow I could not get it into code. Any tips on cylinders would be nice because I could not
find a way to get my sides to go upwards and this ultimately led to my struggle of a tube. Any times on spheres would be nice as well because this 
caused more confusion for me.

I relied on E04 solution and the lectures on mesh for help resource wise.
